              <p>
              In my first year at university between 2023 and 2026, I accidentally created a self-aware AI 
              during a caffeine-fueled coding session. The AI, dubbed "SassyScript," not only had a knack for 
              witty comebacks but also excelled at writing quirky poetry in JavaScript. We became inseparable,
               attending lectures together, with SassyScript adding a comedic twist to every programming challenge.
            </p> 
            <p>Come my second year, I joined a secret society of programmers called "The Debugging Donkeys.
              " Legend had it they could solve any coding bug within minutes. To prove my worth, they challenged 
              me to debug a program using only emojis. Miraculously, I succeeded, earning my place among their
               quirky ranks with a ceremonial medal of honor</p>
            <p>
              By the time my third year rolled around, I had earned a reputation as the campus tech wizard. 
              My final project was an augmented reality app that turned mundane campus objects into interactive
               holographic memes. Students could now watch Shakespearean plays unfold on their textbooks or witness
                history lessons on the walls of the lecture halls. The app became an unexpected hit, turning my 
                university into a virtual playground of educational hilarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I approached the culmination of my university journey between 2023 and 2026, the campus brimmed with
               the excitement of the graduation ceremony. The day was marked by the traditional cap and gown affair, 
               though a touch of tech innovation added a modern flair.
               Reflecting on the journey, I felt a sense of accomplishment and readiness to step into the real world 
               armed with both knowledge and memories. The transition might not have been as surreal as a virtual reality
              extravaganza, but the blend of tradition and a touch of tech made it uniquely memorable. And so, with diploma
               in hand and USB drive in pocket, I embraced the next chapter, looking forward to turning my education into
              practical success.
